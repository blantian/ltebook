These fonts are Menksoft fonts. They are available from http://www.menksoft.com/site/alias__menkcms/2805/Default.aspx

All font copyrights belong to Menksoft.  

Font names that start with "Menksoft..." are TrueType fonts. Others (like MQG8F02) are OpenType fonts.
The OpenType smart font logic contained in the app is not used by mongol-library so you can make
your app smaller by using the TrueType versions. However, the TrueType fonts lack some non-Mongolian
characters, so if you need these then you may want to user the OpenType version of the font. You can
use FontForge or another font viewing software to compare the glyphs. Another thing to note is that
some of the TrueType fonts have a ligature error that does not allow strings like "fi" to form correctly.
